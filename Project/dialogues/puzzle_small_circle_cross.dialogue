Voice: I’m calling to complain about an inaccuracy in your most recent episode. [b]You said that in chapter 3 of Peterus Del Vinicio’s fifth novel, the Lady of Wrath and Fire calles out to her cousin Perullus The Bold,  who she recognized because he had a circle shield with a triangular mountain on it.[/b]  Anyways, that’s obviously nonsense, because on the seventh page of the fourth novel, the Lady of Wrath and Fire called him Perullus The Brave, not The Bold. Honestly it’s really embarrassing you would get that wrong. You’re clearly fake fans, and you should be ashamed!
