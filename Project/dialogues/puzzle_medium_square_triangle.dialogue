Voice: Hiiiiii, so, you know how I said I’d wait for you to come pick me up? Yeah, well about that…. I got bored, so I figured I could just walk to your, and it was all going fine, and I obviously knew where I was going but it um… yeah anyways it turns out I’m lost? I’m at the intersection of 1st and 2nd street, by that big box store with the square sign? Yeah if you could come pick me up that would be great. I’ll just be…. standing here…. by the crossroads. You know. Waiting. Totally not lost or anything.
