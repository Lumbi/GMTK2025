Voice: It’s going to be great, we’re planning a bunch of celebrations all month, for Chilean independence! You’ve got to come celebrate with us, at least one of the days. There’s lots of options, because we’re planning stuff every weekend of the month! I’m sure you can come to at least one of the things I planned. Right? You can come to at least one? Of the events? There’s so many!
