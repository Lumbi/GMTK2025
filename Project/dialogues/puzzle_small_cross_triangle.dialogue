Voice: Hi mom, I’m just calling about the car. Thanks soooooo much for letting me borrow it. Um, just to make sure I get this right, it’s diesel, right? It was a little bit hard to get the pump in at first, but I managed to get it jammed in there, so that’s good, right?[b] Anyways, the little symbol with the circle and the x inside of it is really flashing, which probably means everything is great, right?[/b] I think this is your voicemail, should I call Dad?
