The final grain in the great [b]hourglass of the universe is hurtling towards the precipice, towards the edge,[/b] towards the great and mighty void form which all comes and to which we shall all return, [b]the sand timer of the universe, the cosmic joining of sand and air, the eternal void of gravity calling every second, every moment, down and ever away.[/b] The END!!! BEWARE!!!!
