Voice:[color=gold] Hi, I’m calling to enquire about the car you posted on Facebook Marketplace, is it still for sale? The Citroën DS 1955? Yeah, is it still available? I saw the price, and I’d be willing to buy it for a 50% discount, which I think is really fair. I mean come on, it’s a 70 year old car! Also I saw your profile picture, do you want to go on a date? Haha just kidding. I mean. Unless?[/color]
