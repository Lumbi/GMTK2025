Voice:[color=gold]Hiiii yeah it’s me again, I’m just calling to follow up about that concert you said you were going to play at? You told me it would be on the third, but I can’t remember what month! You know you how it is with time, it’s so slippery! I swear, I woke up yesterday and I could not remember whether it was Monday or Friday. Not idea. Anyways, when you get this can you call me back? I’m pretty sure I’m free the third this month. And next month probably. The one after that I’ll maybe be busy.[/color]
