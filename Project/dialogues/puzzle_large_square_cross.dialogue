Voice: I heard the craziest thing last night, you’re never going to believe this. You know how that ice cream shop opened across the street? Well I heard that they’re giving all their different flavors rankings- not silver and gold and stuff, but gold and platinum and diamond! Isn’t that the most pretentious thing you’ve ever heard? Anyways, obviously I went there. Got a cone. The diamond tier one. It was fine, I guess.
