Voice: Hey bro, sorry about your microwave. That's such a bummer that it's busted man. But like, don't worry, the same exact thing happened to a buddy of mine when he tried to microwave a can of sprite, and he said it's like, totally fixable. What you gotta do is flip your microwave, and then find the little square panel on the bottom, right? and then you take a screwdriver and just pry it up, and you look for a little triangle tab, like a little plastic triangle gizmo. And then you just yank that out  and it'll totally fixed trust me bro.
